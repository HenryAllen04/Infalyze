# Infalyze

An open-source, programmable smart assistant platform built with Raspberry Pi and OpenAI's Assistant API.

## Overview

InfalyzeSmartAssistant is a DIY smart speaker alternative that gives users complete control over their voice assistant experience. Built on affordable Raspberry Pi hardware, it combines the intelligence of OpenAI's large language models with a visual programming interface that makes it easy for anyone to customize and extend functionality.

Unlike proprietary smart speakers, SmartAssistant is designed to be educational, transparent, and fully customizable. The visual programming environment (inspired by Scratch) enables users of all skill levels to create new capabilities without traditional coding knowledge.

## Key Features

- **Voice-activated assistant** powered by OpenAI's Assistant API
- **Visual programming interface** for creating custom skills
- **Open API architecture** for connecting to any web service
- **Offline capabilities** for core functionality
- **Web-based management** with device syncing
- **Educational design** perfect for learning and teaching
- **Privacy-focused** with local processing options
- **Maker-friendly hardware** based on Raspberry Pi

## Architecture

SmartAssistant consists of two main components:

1. **Device Runtime**: Python application running on Raspberry Pi that handles:
   - Wake word detection
   - Voice recognition (using OpenAI Whisper)
   - Program execution
   - Text-to-speech output
   - API integrations

2. **Web Application**: React-based interface that provides:
   - Visual programming environment
   - Program management and deployment
   - Device configuration
   - User account management

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) or Raspberry Pi 5
- Microphone array (ReSpeaker 4-Mic recommended)
- Speaker (or audio HAT)
- Optional: 7" touchscreen display
- Power supply (5V/3A)
- Case

### Software Setup

1. Flash the SmartAssistant image to your Raspberry Pi
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=smart_assistant.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
   ```

2. Connect to your Raspberry Pi and run the setup script
   ```bash
   ssh pi@smart-assistant.local
   cd smart_assistant
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Register for an account on the SmartAssistant web portal at https://smartassistant.example.com

4. Follow the device pairing instructions to connect your Raspberry Pi

## Creating Your First Program

1. Log in to the SmartAssistant web portal
2. Go to "Programs" and click "Create New"
3. Use the visual editor to create a simple program:
   - Add a "When I say" trigger block
   - Enter your trigger phrase (e.g., "What's the weather?")
   - Connect an "API Request" block to a weather service
   - Add a "Respond with" block to format the response
4. Click "Deploy to Device"
5. Test by saying your wake word followed by the trigger phrase

## Educational Applications

SmartAssistant is designed as a platform for learning about:

- Voice interaction
- API integrations
- Programming concepts
- Natural language processing
- Electronics and hardware

The visual programming environment makes these concepts accessible to beginners, while the open architecture provides advanced users with unlimited possibilities for customization.

## Business Model

### Core Revenue Streams
